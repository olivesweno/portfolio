            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I'm Oliver and I'm from North Wales, Anglesey. I love all sports - mainly basketball, volleyball, 
            American-football and lots others. I have 7 dogs, I go to the gym, both of which take up a lot of time
            of my day... <strong>when I'm not working.</strong> <br> I got into code as I was finishing school 
            with no idea what to do, and realising I'm constantly using computers, so why not make 
            it a job? My dad, with help, found CommandShift for me! <br> I've started applying to tons of
            apprenticeships with hopes that I can continue my learning once this course has finished.</p>
